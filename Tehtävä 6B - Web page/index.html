            <p>Winnie-the-Pooh is a 1926 children's book by English author A. A. Milne and English illustrator E. H. Shepard. 
                The book is set in the fictional Hundred Acre Wood, with a collection of short stories following the adventures
                of an anthropomorphic teddy bear, Winnie-the-Pooh, and his friends Christopher Robin, Piglet, Eeyore, Owl, Rabbit, 
                Kanga, and Roo. It is the first of two story collections by Milne about Winnie-the-Pooh, the second being The House 
                at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne and Shepard collaborated previously for English humour magazine Punch, and in 1924 
                created When We Were Very Young, a poetry collection. Among the characters in the poetry book was a teddy bear 
                Shepard modelled after his son's toy. Following this, Shepard encouraged Milne to write about his son Christopher 
                Robin Milne's toys, and so they became the inspiration for the characters in Winnie-the-Pooh. </p>
